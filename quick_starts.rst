Quick Start Guides
-----------------------------------------------

..
    New Repositories will should be directly linked to the subproject path. For
    example: `/projects/base-tutorial-repo/`

These include short guides through common tasks.

    * - Quickstart
      - Platform
      - Notes
    * - |Create a CyVerse account|
      - User Portal
      - Start here to create your own account
    * - |Import data from NCBI SRA using the Discovery Environment|
      -  Discovery Environment
      - The NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is a repository for high-throughput
        sequencing reads. These are valuable data for novel analysis and reuse.
        You can directly import data from SRA into your Data Store using a
        Discovery Environment app.
    * - |Evaluate High-throughput Sequencing Reads with FastQC|
      - Discovery Environment
      - FastQC is a popular tool for evaluating the quality of high-throughput sequencing
        reads such as from Illumina and PacBio.
    * - |Filter, Trim, and Process High-throughput Sequencing Reads with Trimmomatic|
      - Discovery Environment
      - Trimmomatic is a popular application for filtering and trimming high-
        throughput sequencing reads. Several functions can remove populations of
        low quality reads, remove sequencing adaptors, and trim low-quality
        regions of individual reads.
    * - |EZ installation of popular data science tools|
      - Atmosphere and Jetstream
      - Install anaconda (Python 2 or 3, R, Jupyter notebooks), Rstudio,
        Singularity, or Docker easily on any Atmosphere or Jetstream cloud
        computer (instance).
    * - |Submit High-throughput Sequencing Reads to NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)|
      - Discovery Environment
      - The SRA is a canonical repository for sequencing data generated by
        high-throughput instruments. The CyVerse submission pipeline allows you
        to directly submit your data into an SRA-linked BioProject.
    * - |Request a DOI|
      - Data Store, Discovery Environment
      - Organize your dataset and request a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).
    * - |Create a Group Project|
      - Data Store, Discovery Environment
      - Learn the basic steps for setting up a collaborative project using
        CyVerse.
