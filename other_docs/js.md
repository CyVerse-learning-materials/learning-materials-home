# Jetstream

Jetstream is CyVerse Atmosphere deployed on [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/). Allocations can be requested using the [XSEDE portal](https://portal.xsede.org/).

With Jetstream, you can launch larger VMs than on CyVerse (currently up to 44-cores) with an option for GPU computing in the near future.
