# DNA Subway

![subway_logo](assets/dna_subway/dnasubway-icon.png)

## Goal

DNA Subway is an educational bioinformatics platform developed by CyVerse. 
It bundles research-grade bioinformatics tools, high-performance computing, and databases into workflows with an easy-to-use interface. 
"Riding" DNA Subway lines, students can predict and annotate genes in up to 150kb of DNA (Red Line), identify homologs in sequenced genomes (Yellow Line), identify species using DNA barcodes and phylogenetic trees (Blue Line), examine RNA-Seq datasets for differential transcript abundance (Green Line), and analyze
metabarcoding and eDNA samples using QIIME (Purple Line).

## Prerequisites

*In order to complete this tutorial you will need access to the following services/software*

| Prerequisite | Preparation/Notes | Link/Download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CyVerse account | You will need a CyVerse account to complete this exercise | [Register](https://user.cyverse.org/) |
| DNA Subway Access | DNA Subway access is by request access | Check or request access: [CyVerse User Portal](https://user.cyverse.org/services/mine) |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DNA Subway Basics and Logging in to Subway

DNA Subway is designed to be a classroom-friendly approach to
bioinformatics. Unlike most CyVerse platforms, you can even use Subway
without registering for a CyVerse account. We do encourage you to
register however, only work from registered users can be saved. DNA
Subway uses the same open-source bioinformatics tools used by
researchers. See a [complete list of the
tools](https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/about/resources.html) provided in
the Subway pipelines.

**Some things to remember about the platform**

*Registered user and Guest user account types*

-   DNA Subway access must be requested through the CyVerse user portal.
    You can check if you already have access, or request access by
    logging into the portal and visiting the [My
    Services](https://user.cyverse.org/services/mine) page. If DNA
    Subway is not listed, click on
    [Available](https://user.cyverse.org/services/available) services to
    request access.
-   Guest users will not have their worked saved beyond a single DNA
    Subway session. They are also disallowed from using one of the gene
    predictors (FGenesH) in the genomic annotation pipeline (Red Line).
-   We suggest that every student using DNA Subway obtain their own
    account.

*Sample Datasets and reference data*

All Subway lines accept user data and also have sample data that can be
immediately used to create a project.

-   **Red Line - Genome Annotation:** Samples of plant and animal
    genomes that can be used in annotation projects
-   **Yellow Line - TARGeT Search for transposons and other DNA
    Sequences:** Several model plant genomes
-   **Blue Line - DNA Barcoding and Phylogenetics:** Sample sequence
    from plant, animal, fungal, and bacterial barcoding regions; human
    mitochondrial DNA sequence
-   **Green Line - RNA-Seq for differential expression:** Sample
    high-throughput reads from RNA-Seq experiments

If there is a reference data set or sample sequence you would like
added, you can contact CyVerse using the DNA Subway [Contact
page](https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/feedback.html)

*Public and private projects* - DNA Subway projects are private by
default, but can be shared by making them public. Public projects are
searchable and are a great way to share data or present analysis for
grading in a classroom project.
