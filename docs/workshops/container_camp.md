# Container Camp

CyVerse teaches in-person and virtual workshops on the use of software containers for scientific research. 

Currently, we teach both a 'beginning' and 'advanced' format for new and advanced users. Introductory camps are offered prior to advanced camps to allow users to level up or refresh their container skills.
