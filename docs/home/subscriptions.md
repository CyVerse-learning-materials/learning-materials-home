!!! Success "Teaching with CyVerse"

	CyVerse was built as a free to use, open source cyberinfrastructure project for everyone to use. It is a privilege to offer access to the most cutting edge data science tools and computing environments in the world to students from the most under resourced and under served corners of our country with the worst internet connections.

	Free "basic" account holders are intended to be undergraduates or continuing education students. The "basic" account comes with enough computing hours in the Discovery Environment for a student to complete two semester's worth (one academic year) of a courses computational assignments.

	Students should be mindful of their allocation hours and use them conservatively. Analyses should not be left idle or running overnight when not in use, as they take away from the shared resource pool, and they rapidly deplete a student's free account.

	Teachers should purchase a "Pro" or "Commericial" subscription, so that they can share data with their students, and request a Community Release folder, if need be.
