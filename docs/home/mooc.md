# Self-Guided Courses

[CyVerse Self-Guided Course (USA version)](https://cyverse-learning-materials.github.io/cyverse_mooc/){target=_blank}  

Created: 2022-02-14 

In collaboration with CyVerse Austria and CyVerse UK, we have created a massive open online course (MOOC) for self-guided students, covering the basics of data management and analysis in CyVerse. This is a perfect starting point for new CyVerse users to get a basic understanding of how their computational workflows and data lifecycles can work in CyVerse.
