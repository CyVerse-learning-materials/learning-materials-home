# Interactive Analysis on the Discovery Environment

**VICE** stands for Visual Interactive Computing Environment and is a part of CyVerse [Discovery Environment (DE)](https://de.cyverse.org).

**VICE** allows verified CyVerse users to launch customized containers of their favorite data science platforms.

# What is the big idea?

The DE supports executable applications which run as workflows on high performance or high throughput computing environments. **VICE** introduces Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) and common Integrated Development Environments (IDE) such as [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), & Remote Desktops to the DE.
