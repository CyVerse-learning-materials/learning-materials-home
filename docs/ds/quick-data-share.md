6. You can also generate a Public URL for files, making it easier to share your files. To do so, click on the 3 dots on the right of the file, and click Public Link(s). A window will appear with the generated URL, 
which can be used by collaborators in order to download your file.

!!! Warning
    Generating a public URL works for files, not folders! It is suggested to compress large number of files prior to sharing them.
