# Moving Data

There are several ways to move data between the Data Store and other computers, whether your local machine or a remote one. These methods vary in speed, flexibility, and technical knowledge necessary to use them. You may find that different methods suit your needs for different projects at different times.

  2. Using the [CyberDuck](../cyberduck.md) desktop application
  3. Through the [iCommands](../icommands.md) and command-line
  4. Through an HTTPS connection using [WebDAV](../webdav.md)
  	- Can also be used to create links for external download
  5. Through the [SFTP](../sftp.md) via a command-line tool or desktop applications
