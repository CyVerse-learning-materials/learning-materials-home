6. You can also generate a public URL for files, making it easier to share your files. To do so, click on the ellipses (3 dots) on the right of the file, and click Public Link(s). A window will appear with the generated URL, 
which collaborators can use to download your file.

    !!! Warning "Generating a public URL works for files, not folders! It is suggested to compress large numbers of files prior to sharing them."
