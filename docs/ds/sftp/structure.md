# SFTP Directory Structure

When accessing the Data Store via SFTP, you'll encounter a different directory structure compared to other tools like GoCommands and iCommands. SFTP users have access to following directories:

## :material-folder-multiple-outline: Home Directory

`/<username>`

- Maps to your iRODS home directory `/iplant/home/<username>`
- Read and write access for the owner
- Not provided to anonymous users

## :material-folder-multiple-outline: Community-shared Data Directory

`/shared`

- Maps to the iRODS community-shared data directory: `/iplant/home/shared`
- Read-only access

## :material-folder-multiple-outline: `.ssh` Directory

`/.ssh`

- Automatically generated by the SFTP service
- Not used and should be ignored
- Distinct from `/<username>/.ssh`

For password-less public-key authentication, use `/<username>/.ssh` instead.
