### Installing iCommands on Windows and macOS

iCommands has limited support for Windows and macOS. Alternative methods are recommended for accessing the Data Store on these platforms:

1. **Windows**: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to install iCommands.

2. **macOS**: CyVerse provides an iCommands 4.1.9 installer, but updates may be infrequent.
   - [cyverse-icommands-4.1.9.pkg](https://cyverse.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/241869823/cyverse-icommands-4.1.9.pkg?version=3&modificationDate=1472820029000&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

#### Recommended Alternative: GoCommands

GoCommands is a cross-platform tool that offers similar functionality to iCommands:

- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No installation required
- Provides user commands for data access

For instructions on using GoCommands, refer to the [GoCommands documentation](../gocommands/index.md).
