### Installing iCommands on Windows and macOS

iCommands has limited support for Windows and macOS. While there are options available, such as using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or custom iCommands packages for macOS, we highly recommend using GoCommands as a more versatile alternative.

GoCommands is a cross-platform tool that offers similar functionality to iCommands with several advantages:

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **No installation required**: Simply download and run the executable
- **User-friendly commands**: Provides essential data access functions

For detailed instructions on downloading, setting up, and using GoCommands, please refer to the [GoCommands documentation](../gocommands/index.md).

### Request Support

If you encounter an issue that you cannot resolve, please contact [support@cyverse.org](mailto:support@cyverse.org) for assistance. Your Data Store access via iCommands may be limited or fail due to various factors, including configuration issues, network problems, authentication errors, or data policies. The support team is available to help you identify and resolve these issues.
