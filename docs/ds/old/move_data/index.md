# Moving Data

There are several ways to move data between the CyVerse Data Store and other computers, whether your local machine or a remote one. These methods vary in speed, flexibility, and technical knowledge necessary to use them. You may find that different methods suit your needs for different projects at different times.

The **Moving Data** section covers each of the following methods of moving data to the Data Store:

  1. Using the [Discovery Environment](../de/manage_data.md) web interface (visit the [Distributing Data quickstart](../de/share.md) for a rapid introduction to distributing data)
  2. Using the [CyberDuck](../cyberduck/index.md) desktop application
  3. Through the [iCommands](../icommands/index.md) and command-line
  4. Through an HTTPS connection using [WebDAV](../webdav/index.md)
  	- Can also be used to create links for external download
