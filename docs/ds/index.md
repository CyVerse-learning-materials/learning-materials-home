CyVerse Data Store runs the [Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS)](https://irods.org){target=_blank} Open Source Data Management Software.

iRODS helps researchers, archivists, and others manage large, geographically dispersed computer files by providing a virtual filesystem, metadata catalog, and a rule engine to automate data management and enforce policies. 

The Data Store is designed for storing, managing, and sharing your data throughout its entire lifecycle. 

Integrated across all CyVerse platforms, the Data Store has high accessibility and connectivity.  

The Data Store's features are aimed at helping you maintain data integrity and value, while making your data more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) with minimal effort.

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started, assuming youâ€™ve already created a CyVerse account.
