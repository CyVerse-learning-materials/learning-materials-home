CyVerse Data Store runs the [Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS)](https://irods.org){target=_blank} Open Source Data Management Software.

iRODS helps researchers, archivists, and others manage large, geographically dispersed computer files by providing a virtual filesystem, metadata catalog, and a rule engine to automate data management and enforce policies. 

The Data Store is designed for storing, managing, and sharing your data throughout its entire lifecycle. 

Integrated across all CyVerse platforms, the Data Store has high accessibility and connectivity.  

The Data Store's features are aimed at helping you maintain data integrity and value, while making your data more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) with minimal effort.

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started, assuming youâ€™ve already created a CyVerse account.

# Moving Data

There are several ways to move data between the CyVerse Data Store and other computers, whether your local machine or a remote one. These methods vary in speed, flexibility, and technical knowledge necessary to use them. You may find that different methods suit your needs for different projects at different times.

The **Moving Data** section covers each of the following methods of moving data to the Data Store:

  1. Using the [Discovery Environment](../../de/index.md) web interface (visit the [Distributing Data quickstart](../share.md) for a rapid introduction to distributing data)
  2. Using the [CyberDuck](../cyberduck.md) desktop application
  3. Through the [iCommands](../icommands.md) and command-line
  4. Through an HTTPS connection using [WebDAV](../webdav.md)
    - Can also be used to create links for external download
  5. Through the [SFTP](../sftp.md) via a command-line tool or desktop applications
  6. Through the [GoCommands](../gocommands.md) and command-line
