# Discovery Environment Login and Setup

**Description:**

In this section we will create a folder in the Discovery Environment
(DE) and begin organizing a space for our experimental data and analysis
results on the Data Store.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *CyVerse Account Setup*

1.  Obtain a CyVerse account at [CyVerse User Portal](https://user.cyverse.org/). Register with an institutional email
    address (e.g., .edu or .org) if possible. If you previously have had
    a CyVerse account, you can also recover or reset your password on
    this site. After signup, you will need to verify your email address
    in order to activate your account.

## *Discovery Environment Login and Data Sharing Setup*

1.  Log in to the [Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org/).
2.  Click on **Data** to browse your collection of files and navigate to
    your home folder (i.e., top folder labeled with your CyVerse
    username).
3.  Click the **Folder** button to create a new folder for this project
    (suggested name: **rna-seq-tutorial**).

!!! Note
        You should avoid using spaces or special characters (e.g., !@#\$%\^&)
        in any folder or file names.

4.  Once you have created this folder, you may want to share it with
    collaborators. To do so, select (checkbox) the **rna-seq-tutorial**
    folder in your **Data** view. Then, click the **Share** button.
5.  (Optional) You can then enter the names (i.e., name, username, email
    address) of collaborators you wish to share data with. These
    collaborators must also have a CyVerse account. Once you have found
    collaborators to share with, you must select the level of access you
    wish to grant.

!!! Tip
        See more on Data sharing in thr [Data Store Guide](https://learning.cyverse.org/de/manage_data/).
## *More on the Discovery Environment*

**Layout of the Discovery Environment**

The Discovery Environment is a web-based graphical user interface that
allows CyVerse users to manage, share, and annotate data, launch
analysis jobs using applications, and log the status and history of
analyses.

In this expanded view the left sidebar menu:

- **(A)** shows several icons: Home presents the default view at login
with access to recently used and favorite applications;
    -   **Data** shows a view of the CyVerse Data Store including
        publicly available (community) data; when logged in you will
        view your uploaded and shared files and folders. You will also
        access menu-based data management tools (e.g., upload, folder
        and file creation, file previews, sharing, search and metadata)
        in this view.
    -   **Apps** provides view of the application catalogue, as well as
        tools for modifying and creating new applications and workflows.
    -   **Analyses** provides view of job history, and the status of
        submitted and running jobs. Job management features include the
        ability to cancel or relaunch jobs and view detailed job
        parameters.
    -   **Cloud Shell** provides a limited Linux-based shell interface.
    -   **Teams** allows you to select and manage user groups.
    -   **Collections** allows you to select and manage groupings of
        applications and resources.
    -   **Settings** allows you to see and change default setting for
        the platform.
    -   **Help** allows you access to help resources.
- **The Search bar (B)** allows you to search across data, applications, and analyses.
- **Additional functions (C)** include login and account information, notifications, help, and collections.
