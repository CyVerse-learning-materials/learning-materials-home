# Upload Files to the Data Store

**Description:**

We upload the metadata and accession list from SRA into our project
folder on the Data Store.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *Upload Metadata to Data Store*

We will upload the metadata and accession files to the Data Store. The
metadata file is a CSV file organized as a spreadsheet.

1.  In the [Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org/) **Data** view, navigate to **rna-seq-tutorial** folder you
    previously created; once inside this folder click the **Upload**
    button, then select **Browse Local**.

2.  Browse your local computer to select the accession list downloaded
    from the SRA (i.e., **SRR_Acc_List.txt**). Upload the file.

!!! Note
        You will get a notification when upload is completed. You may need
        to refresh your browser to see the uploaded file.

3\.  To organize this and other uploads, click the **Folder** button to
    create a folder (suggested name: **metadata**) inside the
    **rna-seq-tutorial** folder. Select (checkbox) the uploaded file
    (i.e., **SRR_Acc_List.txt**) and click the **More Actions** button;
    choose **Move** and then use the **Browse** button to select the
    created **metadata** folder as your destination to move these files
    to. Click **Move** to complete this action. You may need to refresh
    your browser to see changes.
