# [Discovery Environment Guide ![de](../assets/de/logos/deIcon.svg){ width="50" }](https://de.cyverse.org/de){target=_blank}

The Discovery Environment (DE) is an all-purpose informatics workspace, with an interface tailored to the needs of researchers with data to analyze but who may lack command line expertise or the compute resources to run software tools and analyses.

-   All data (yours, shared, and public) are stored in CyVerse's cloud-based Data Store and are accessible from anywhere in CyVerse, including the DE.
-   All analyses run on CyVerse's cloud and High Performance Computing resources, enabling you to run analyses, small to large, beyond what your personal computer can typically handle.
-   For most tasks (e.g., launching an app or importing data from a URL) you can log out or navigate to another page or operation after you start the task; an automated email notification is sent to you when the task is completed.
