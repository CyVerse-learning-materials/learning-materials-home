# Discovery Environment Guide

<img src="./assets/de/deIcon.png" alt="DE Logo" width="253px" height="117px">

## Goal

The Discovery Environment (DE) is an all-purpose informatics workspace,
with an interface tailored to the needs of researchers with data to
analyze but who may lack command line expertise or the compute resources
to run software tools and analyses.


**Quick FYIs about the Discovery Environment**

-   All data (yours, shared, and public) are stored in CyVerse's
    cloud-based Data Store and are accessible from anywhere in CyVerse,
    including the DE.
-   All computations run on CyVerse's compute resources, enabling you to
    run analyses, small to large, beyond what your personal computer can
    typically handle.
-   For most tasks (e.g., launching an app or importing data from a URL)
    you can log out or navigate to another page or operation after you
    start the task; an automated email notification is sent to you when
    the task is completed.
