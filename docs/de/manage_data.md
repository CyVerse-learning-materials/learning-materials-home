# Managing Data in the Discovery Environment

With CyVerse, you can manage data throughout the data lifecycle, from uploading, to adding metadata, to analyzing, sharing results, and making your data public for others to reuse. The Discovery Environment interface is one way to access, view, and manage your files in the CyVerse Data Store.


## Browsing Data in the Discovery Environment

1.  Begin by clicking on the Data icon in the left sidebar. You will need to log in to access your data directory.  To see and browse through information about your data files in the     Data view, press the `&Customize Columns`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to select more (or fewer) columns to display, such as size, modification date, permissions, etc.
2.  If the folder you\'re viewing has many items in it, use the \< or \> at the bottom of the page to move between pages. You can also change the number of items displayed per page.
3.  Click on the name of a subfolder to open that folder. As you access folders or files within your directory, breadcrumbs near the top of the page show the folder you are viewing and its parent folder(s).
4.  From the top left, at the start of the breadcrumbs, you may select another root folder to view from within your home folder; clicking on the dropdown near your username will allow you to browse folders/files in \"Shared With Me\", \"Community Data\", or \"Trash\".

## Viewing File/Folder Details in the Discovery Environment

Both the `&Details`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button near the
top right and the More Options menu (ellipsis) at the far right in a
file or folder\'s row allow you to view and manage several types of
information about your file/folder.

You must be logged in to view file/folder details.

1.  From the Data view, click the checkbox next to a file or folder to
    select it and then click the `&Details`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} or the ellipsis to see specific information about
    the selected item, to copy the file path to the item, to add tags to
    the item, to edit metadata, or to set a file\'s info type.
2.  To view your own permissions on the item and those of other users,
    click the \'Permissions\' tab under "Details".

## Deleting Files/Folders in the Discovery Environment

You must be logged in to delete files/folders.

1.  From the Data view, select the desired file/folder by clicking the
    checkbox to its left. You can select multiple files/folders. To
    unselect an individual file/folder, click the checkbox again. To
    select (or unselect) all files/folders, click the checkbox at the
    top of the list.

2.  Click on the More Options menu (ellipsis) in the upper right corner
    of the Data view and select **Delete** from the pop-up menu. When
    the file has been fully deleted, you will receive an automated
    notification under the notification icon . When deleting or moving a
    file/folder, you must receive the completion notification before you
    can change anything associated with that file/folder.

    Deleted files can be retrieved from your Trash. To access your Trash
    folder, click on your username in the top left corner of the Data
    view.

## Uploading/Importing Small Files in the Discovery Environment

You can use the DE interface to upload smaller files (\<2GB). For larger
files or large numbers of files, we recommend using faster methods such
as Cyberduck or iCommands. See the documentation for those tools in our
.

**Important**

-   When up- or downloading data from your desktop/PC, you must remain
    on the Data view until the task completes.
-   When importing data from a URL, you can log out or navigate to
    another page or operation after you start the import; an automated
    email notification is sent to you when the task is complete.
-   You must be logged in to upload/import files.

1.  Click the **Data** button in the Discovery Environment's left
    sidebar to access the Data view.

2.  The Data view shows a directory of the files and folders in your
    Data Store. You can select an existing folder as the destination for
    your uploaded file(s) or click the **Folder** button to create a new
    folder. If you do not select a destination, the default file
    destination is your home Data Store folder (i.e.,
    iplant/home/CYVERSE_USERNAME).

3.  Click the `&Upload`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to
    choose your options for importing files into the Data Store:

    > -   To upload files from your local computer, choose **Browse
    >     Local**; a file browser will open and you may select files to
    >     upload.
    > -   To upload files from a URL, choose **Import by URL**; you may
    >     paste in a valid HTTP or an FTP URL, then click **Import**.
    >     You may paste additional URLs or close this window by clicking
    >     **Done**.

4.  When you have begun the upload, you will get an automated
    notification that the file(s) has been queued. To view the status of
    an upload or import, go click the **Upload** button and choose
    **View Upload Queue**.

    ::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    The queue will only display the status of uploads from local files.
    Files imported by URL will generate an automated notification (bell
    icon, upper-right) upon completion (or failure) to upload.

## Advanced Data Management Features in the Discovery Environment

The Discovery Environment also supports advanced data management tasks
such as organizing your datasets, associating data with metadata,
requesting a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), and importing or
submitting data to/from NCBI SRA. For information on these advanced
features, see .
