# Logging in to the Discovery Environment (DE)

When you first arrive at the Discovery Environment (https://de.cyverse.org), you'll see the Dashboard. The Dashboard contains links to news, CyVerse videos, and featured apps you can use. The left sidebar shows icons for accessing different parts of the DE, like Data or Apps.

1. To log in from the Dashboard, navigate to the upper right corner of the DE and click the [profile icon](./assets/de/profile_icon.png).
2. Enter your CyVerse username and password. If you don't have an account yet or you've forgotten your password, you can visit (https://user.cyverse.org) to create an account or reset your password..
3. After logging in, you'll be returned to the previous view. For example, if you were on the Apps view when you logged in, you'll return to that view.
4. You can take a short tour of the DE's main features by clicking the
[help icon](./assets/de/help_icon.png) in the left sidebar and selecting "Product Tour".
