# Harbor

CyVerse operates a [Harbor.io](https://goharbor.io){target=_blank} container registry for its featured applications.

CyVerse subscribers can request that they're applications be published in the Discovery Environment, and receive hosting for their containers in the [https://harbor.cyverse.org](https://harbor.cyverse.org){target=_blank} registry.

Harbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted.
