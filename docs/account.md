# Register for Services

To register for VICE or other services, login to the user portal's dashboard (<https://user.cyverse.org/dashboard>). Under "My Services" click the 'Request Access' button next to the additional service. You will receive an email notification when the service is added; this may take up to 24 hours.

## VICE Access

Since VICE (the Visual Interactive Computing Environment) is a target for cryptocurrency miners, we require an additional verification. 

You will be asked for a description of your intended VICE use: please give non-technical scientific details, and if you can, link an external resource (like a workshop or lab website) and funding agency. 

An institutional email address is required, e.g., .org, .gov, .edu. We do not accept commercial address, e.g., @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, @qq.com. 

Also, please add ORCID <https://orcid.org> to your [CyVerse User Profile](https://user.cyverse.org). If you don't have an ORCID get one today!
