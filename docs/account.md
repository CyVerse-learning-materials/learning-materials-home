3.  Complete the registration process
4.  Check your email for an account confirmation link and follow the confirmation instructions.

!!! tip

	Check your SPAM for the confirmation email if it does not arrive within a few minutes

5. Once you have confirmed your email address, you can start using your CyVerse account right away!

# Registering for Other Services

To register for VICE or other services, login to the user portal's dashboard (<https://user.cyverse.org/dashboard> ). Under "My Services" click the 'Request Access' button next to the additional service. You will receive an email notification when the service is added; this may take up to 24 hours.

## VICE Access

Since VICE (the Visual Interactive Computing Environment) is a target for cryptocurrency miners, we require an additional verification step. You will be asked for a description of your intended VICE use- be sure to give detail, and if you can, link to an external resource (like a workshop or lab website). Using an institutional email address can help as well.
