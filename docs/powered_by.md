Through our unique Powered by CyVerse program, third-party projects can leverage CyVerse cyberinfrastructure to provide their users with robust services such as secure single sign-on with authentication, easy and fast data transfers, access to large-scale, High-Performance Compute resources such as Jetstream or XSEDE, as well as expertise from developers and domain scientists.
