# Getting Help

First, try seeing if your question is answered on the [FAQ page](faq.md). Next, try searching the documentation using the search bar at the top of the page. If you still haven't found an answer, click the Intercom icon ![Intercom](assets/intercom.png){ width="25" } on the lower right-hand side of the page to start messaging with a CyVerse specialist.

## Issues with Documentation

If you want to report an issue with the documentation itself, or propose a change to the documentation, you can click on the GitHub icon in the top right of the page to navigate to the GitHub repository, where you can open an Issue. If you would prefer not to use GitHub, feel free to email us feedback at <learning@cyverse.org.
