# Documentation Drafts

In order to ease the process of adding documentation of new features/topics to our site, we created this folder.

Feel free to submit more polished PRs of any new documentation to the repo directly, but you can also use this folder as a place to dump plain-text or Markdown files of anything new. We want to make it easy to just get the material into the repo, where the Science Team can then take on the task of translating it to be more user-focused (if necessary), polishing it, and adding it to the current documentation structure.

If there are any screenshots or other images you need to refer to, feel free to toss them in here as well.
