Welcome to the CyVerse Learning Center (*beta*)
-----------------------------------------------

The CyVerse Learning center is a *beta* release of our learning materials in the popular
"Read the Docs" formatting. We are transitioning our leaning materials into this format
to make them easier to search, use, and update. We will be making regular contributions
to these materials and you can suggest new materials or create and
share your own. If you have ideas or suggestions please email `Tutorials@CyVerse.org <mailto:Tutorials@cyverse.org>`_.
You can also view, edit, and submit contributions on `GitHub <https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials>`_.

Quick Starts
------------

..
    New Repositories will should be directly linked to the subproject path. For
    example: `/projects/base-tutorial-repo/`

These include short guides through common tasks.

    * - Quickstart
      - Platform
      - Notes
    * - `Create a CyVerse account </projects/cyverse-account-creation-quickstart/>`_
      - User Portal
      - Start here to create your own account
    * - `Import data from NCBI SRA using the Discovery Environment </projects/cyverse-importing-sradata-quickstart/>`_
      -  Discovery Environment
      - The NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is a repository for high-throughput
        sequencing reads. These are valuable data for novel analysis and resue.
        You can directly import data from SRA into your Data Store using a
        Discovery Environment app.
    * - `Evaluate High-throughput Sequencing Reads with FastQC <https://cyverse-fastqc-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_
      - Discovery Environment
      - FastQC is a popular tool for evaluating the quality of high-throughput sequencing
        reads such as from Illumina and PacBio.
    * - `Filter, Trim, and Process High-throughput Sequencing Reads with Trimmomatic <https://cyverse-trimmomatic-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_
      - Discovery Environment
      - Trimmomatic is a popular application for filtering and trimming high-
        throughput sequencing reads. Several functions can remove populations of
        low quality reads, remove sequencing adaptors, and trim low-quality
        regions of individual reads.
    * - `EZ installation of popular data scientist tools <https://cyverse-ez-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_
      - Atmosphere and Jetstream
      - Install anaconda (Python 2 or 3, R, Jupyter notebooks), Rstudio, Singularity, or Docker easily on any Atmosphere or Jetstream cloud computer (instance).
    * - `Submit High-throughput Sequencing Reads to NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) <https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/sra_submission_quickstart/en/latest/>`_
      - Discovery Environment
      - The SRA is a canonical repository for sequencing data generated by high-throughput
        instruments. The CyVerse submission pipeline allows you to directly submit
        your data into an SRA-linked BioProject

About CyVerse
-------------

**CyVerse Vision:** Transforming science through data-driven discovery.

**CyVerse Mission:** Design, deploy, and expand a national
cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research and train scientists in
its use. CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational
infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus
enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms
provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud
services, APIs, and more.


While originally created with the name iPlant Collaborative to serve
U.S. plant science communities, CyVerse cyberinfrastructure is germane
to all life sciences disciplines and works equally well on data from
plants, animals, or microbes. By democratizing access to supercomputing
capabilities, we provide a crucial resource to enable scientists to find
solutions for the future. CyVerse is of, by, and for the community, and community-driven needs
shape our mission. We rely on your feedback to provide the
infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and
educational agenda.
